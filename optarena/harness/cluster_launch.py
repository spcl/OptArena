"""Single-job cluster launcher: ONE SLURM allocation, MPI rank -> role.

``optarena launch`` runs under ``srun --mpi=pmix --ntasks-per-node=1`` across the
whole allocation. Each rank owns one node and derives its ROLE from its rank and the
``(inference_endpoints I, nodes_per_vllm K, judge_nodes J)`` counts -- no per-node
config, because the cluster is homogeneous (Daint: every node is 4x GH200) so a
rank-order slice of the nodelist needs no hardware pinning:

* ranks ``[0, I*K)``          -- inference. Consecutive groups of ``K`` ranks form one
  vLLM endpoint; the group's local-rank-0 is the HEAD (runs ``vllm serve``), the other
  ``K-1`` are ray workers (``K>1`` only -- a model too big for one node). Each endpoint
  is one URL the agents round-robin over.
* ranks ``[I*K, I*K + J)``    -- judge. Each runs ``optarena serve`` (the HTTP oracle).
* rank ``0``                  -- ALSO the agent DRIVER (co-located on endpoint-0's head).
  The agent loop is an HTTP client -- GPU-idle -- so it rides the vLLM node without
  disturbing the CPU-bound judge timings.

So the allocation is ``N = I*K + J`` nodes. The ranks ``allgather`` their hostnames, the
driver assembles the vLLM + judge URL lists in rank order and hands them to the static
pipeline (:func:`optarena.harness.pipeline.run_static`), where worker ``w`` binds to
``vllm_urls[w % I]`` (think) + ``judge_urls[w % J]`` (grade). Two barriers bound the run:
one after every rank has launched its server, one after the driver finishes (holding the
server ranks alive meanwhile); then every rank tears its server down and they exit
together.

``vllm`` is assumed on ``PATH`` (a site module / venv); the launcher only orchestrates
placement, it does not provision vLLM. The pure planning helpers (:func:`plan_roles`,
:func:`assemble_urls`) carry no MPI dependency so they unit-test without a cluster;
:func:`launch` imports ``mpi4py`` lazily.
