"""A range step whose sign is only known at RUNTIME must still iterate the Python direction.

Both native emitters used to decide the loop direction from the emitted TEXT of the step
(``step.startswith("-")``), which is only right for a literal. With ``s = -1`` held in a variable
the text is ``s``, so both picked the positive-step form and diverged silently:

* C emitted ``for (i = lo; i < hi; i += s)`` -- the guard is false at entry, so the loop ran ZERO
  times and the output kept whatever it was initialised with.
* Fortran emitted ``do i = lo, hi - 1, s``. Fortran's DO honours the runtime sign, but the
  inclusive-bound adjustment went the wrong way, so ``range(n, 0, -1)`` ran two iterations too far
  (down to ``-1``) -- out-of-range indices, not merely a wrong count.

Neither failed loudly, which is why this is pinned per backend rather than left to a kernel test.
