# NumpyToNumba

Python (numpy) -> Python (numba-compiled) emitter. Numba supports a
large subset of numpy and pure-Python loops; the translation is:

1. Wrap the kernel function with `@numba.njit` (`@numba.njit(parallel=True)`
   for the `numba_np` variant).
2. Leave the body unchanged.

Numba caveats:

* Some numpy idioms (e.g. fancy indexing with bool arrays) aren't
  supported. We emit them anyway; if numba refuses we surface the
  error at first call.
* `@njit(parallel=True)` rewrites `range` loops via `prange` when
  the harness imports `numba.prange`; we leave that to the existing
  framework wiring (`<short>_numba_np.py` historically uses
  `numba.prange` explicitly).
