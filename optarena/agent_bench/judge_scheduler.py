"""Dynamic device scheduler for the judge, and the two-stage think->grade pipeline.

The judge grades many kernels; each grade runs on ONE device -- a GPU or a CPU
slot, whichever the run is configured for -- and only one kernel occupies a slot
at a time. This module turns a configurable pool of device slots (across a
configurable number of nodes) into a work-stealing dispatcher: every slot gets a
worker that pulls the next pending kernel as soon as it frees, so faster kernels
do not idle a GPU waiting on a slow one. It is the scheduling layer the
native/container judge drives; it holds no grading logic -- the caller passes a
``run_item(item, slot)`` closure that does the actual verify/score.

For the 3-tier ``agent / reference / inference`` topology (agent nodes "think" by
querying the inference server, judge nodes "measure" the reference + candidate),
:class:`TwoStageScheduler` routes each item through a THINK stage on a separate
AGENT pool and then a GRADE stage on the judge pool, the two pools running
concurrently. An item being graded never occupies an agent slot and vice-versa, so
an agent blocked on the inference endpoint never idles a precious timing GPU. Both
schedulers share one work-stealing primitive (:func:`_work_pool`).

Local GPU slots are pinned WITHOUT a ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` env race: the
worker thread records its slot's GPU index in :mod:`native_call`'s thread-local
(`set_assigned_device`), and the spawned device child selects that physical GPU
with ``cp.cuda.Device(index)``. Remote slots (a hostname, from a multi-node
allocation) are addressed by the caller's stage closure via :func:`srun_wrap`.

Config (all optional, read via :func:`optarena.config.get`, so an env override
``OPTARENA_JUDGE_<KEY>`` / ``OPTARENA_AGENT_<KEY>`` works and no ``config.yaml``
entry is required):

* ``judge.gpus_per_node`` -- GPU slots per node (default: detected local GPUs).
* ``judge.cpu_slots_per_node`` -- CPU slots per node (default: 1 when no GPU,
  else 0). A CPU slot runs a host-residency kernel.
* ``judge.nodelist`` -- comma-separated hostnames for a multi-node judge
  (default: empty = one local node). The node count is ``len(nodelist)`` when
  set, else 1.
* ``agent.workers_per_node`` -- concurrent agent (think) workers per agent node
  (default: 1).
* ``agent.nodelist`` -- comma-separated hostnames for the agent pool (default:
  empty = one local node = co-located with the judge, for a single-box run).
