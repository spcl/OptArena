"""Triton banded_mmt — not supported by this framework.

banded_mmt is the dense result of A @ B @ A.T — a sparse triple product
(SpGEMM). Triton has no sparse@sparse primitive (its sparse support is the
gather-reduction SpMV / sparse-times-dense only), and densifying the sparse
operands is disallowed by policy. Unlike JAX (whose BCOO implements
sparse@sparse), there is no close sparse representation here.
