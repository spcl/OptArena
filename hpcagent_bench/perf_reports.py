"""Optional compiler-report + lowered-code dumps, written under ``perf_reports/``.

Two INDEPENDENT capabilities, BOTH OFF BY DEFAULT:

* ``opt_report``   -- what the compiler's vectorizer DID (and at what width) and
  what it REFUSED (and why).
* ``lowered_code`` -- the machine code actually emitted, disassembled.

Neither may perturb a TIMED run, which is enforced structurally rather than by
promise:

* Each knob is off unless explicitly turned on, so a default sweep never runs
  either path.
* Even when on, a report is produced OUTSIDE the timed bracket -- the harness asks
  only after :meth:`Framework.measure` has returned (``frameworks/test.py``).
* The optimization report comes from a SEPARATE compile-only run into a scratch
  directory; the report flags never reach the build whose ``.so`` gets timed. (They
  are in fact codegen-neutral -- ``objdump``'s ``.text`` is byte-identical with and
  without them -- but not relying on that is free, and it also dodges the reverse
  hazard: a cached ``.so`` built without the flags would otherwise have to be
  rebuilt to report on, silently re-timing a different artifact.)
* The disassembly reads the timed ``.so`` that already exists; it never rebuilds.

This module is the MECHANISM only -- where a report goes, and how to disassemble a
library. WHAT a report says is the framework's own answer, via the
:meth:`Framework.opt_report` / :meth:`Framework.lowered_code` hooks; WHEN to ask is
the harness's. It therefore imports nothing from :mod:`hpcagent_bench.frameworks` (which
imports the harness that calls this), and takes the two path components it needs --
``relative_path`` / ``module_name`` -- as plain strings.
