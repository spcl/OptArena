"""``np.arange`` element count under a step -- including a NEGATIVE one.

The count was ``(stop - start + step - 1) // step``, which is a positive-step identity, and the
array holding the result was sized ``stop - start``, which ignores the step entirely. For
``np.arange(10, 0, -1)`` that is a count of 12 in an array of size -10:

* C declared ``int64_t t[-10]`` and did not compile;
* Fortran took the negative bound as an empty array, ran the 12-iteration loop off the end of it,
  and returned garbage -- which the oracle graded as a pass, because the values it compared were
  whatever was on the stack.

Both now come from one :func:`arange_count`, so the extent an array is declared with and the trip
count the loop runs cannot disagree. A step > 1 is here too: it was over-allocating (count
``stop - start`` for ``stop - start`` / step elements), which is wasteful rather than wrong, but
the same expression fixes it.
