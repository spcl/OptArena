WHY THIS IS SAFE WITHOUT CODE CHANGES
The kernel registry discovers manifests with ``base.rglob("*.yaml")`` (spec.py), so a
manifest one directory deeper is still found. ``relative_path`` is derived from the
manifest's parent, and every downstream path -- the numpy reference
(``numpy_reference_path``), the emit output, and its ``cpp_backend/`` -- is derived from
``relative_path`` (autogen.py: ``kdir = BENCHMARKS / relative_path``; ``cppdir = kdir /
"cpp_backend"``). So moving a kernel's files together re-homes all of them at once, with no
loader or emitter edit. ``cpp_backend/`` itself is generated + gitignored and is NOT moved;
it regenerates per-kernel in the new location on the next build.

TRACKED FILES ONLY
Only ``git``-tracked files are moved. A kernel's C/C++/Fortran wrapper (``<stem>_cpp.py``),
its numba/tvm siblings (``<stem>_numba_*.py``, ``<stem>_tvm.py``), and everything under
``cpp_backend/`` are GENERATED and gitignored -- ``git mv`` refuses them, and they do not
need moving: the emitter re-derives their path from ``relative_path`` and regenerates them
in the new subfolder on the next build (any stale flat copy left behind is a gitignored
orphan). So the move set is the tracked artifacts: the manifest, the numpy reference, the
``_original.*`` sources, an optional ``<stem>.py`` initializer, and any tracked ``_mpi.*``.

KERNEL IDENTITY AND THE ONE COLLISION
A kernel is a ``<stem>.yaml`` manifest. A tracked sibling belongs to it when its name is
that stem followed by a suffix (empty, or beginning with ``_`` / ``.``). Assignment is
LONGEST-STEM-FIRST: ``ext_floordiv_offset_m_numpy.py`` is claimed by
``ext_floordiv_offset_m`` (its files start the same way as ``ext_floordiv_offset``'s),
never by the shorter ``ext_floordiv_offset``. That pair is the only prefix collision in the
corpus; longest-first makes the rule general anyway.

Files that match no kernel stem (e.g. ``__init__.py``) are left in place and reported.

Usage:
    python scripts/restructure_foundation.py            # dry-run: print the plan
    python scripts/restructure_foundation.py --apply    # execute the moves via ``git mv``

``git mv`` preserves history and stages the moves; nothing is committed here.
