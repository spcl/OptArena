"""The emit_io write path and its hand-override clobber guard.

:func:`numpyto_common.emit_io.write_generated` owns the single "if a file with the
canonical name already exists, use it; otherwise emit" rule. The clobber guard is the
override branch: a file present WITHOUT a generation marker on its first line is a
hand-written override and is never overwritten (``write_generated`` returns
``"override"`` and leaves it byte-for-byte untouched); a file carrying the marker is
auto-generated and is refreshed (``"ok"``).

These tests pin that contract -- new write, refresh-of-generated, refuse-to-clobber-
override, the subtle "a marker MENTIONED in a line-1 docstring is NOT a marker",
legacy-marker recognition, the C/Fortran comment leads, missing-path classification,
and parent-dir creation. No toolchain is involved, so they always run; all writes are
confined to ``tmp_path``.
